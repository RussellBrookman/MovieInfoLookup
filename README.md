# MovieInfoLookup

This program connects you to IMDB through their Aplication Program Interface (API). An API is a database that's provided by a huge number of different websites. Needless to say, understanding how to use API interfaces is an extremly powerful tool. The pre-programed options I made will provide the user with a few examples, however if you type the name of a movie, you can easily create your own buttons and search the records of any movie you would like. I wrote this program using only a single page of code writing it in HTML, a tiny bit of CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.
